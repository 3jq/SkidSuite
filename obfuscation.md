### Obfuscation

| Tool  | Description  | Price | Link |
|-------|--------------|-------|------|
| **Allatori** | Alltori is a decent obfuscator and has a demo readily available, so for that alone its a good goto. You can't beat free.  | <ul><li>Demo: Free</li><li>Full: $290+</li></ul> | [allatori](http://www.allatori.com/) |
| **DashO** | DashO is a step above Allatori in almost every department. The flow obfuscation is more noticable than in some other obfuscators, the string encryption is more dynamic, and it has more features overall. Sadly it is not free. You can use the trial for one week before it expires. | <ul><li>Trial: 1 Week </li><li>Full: Varies, [~$2000](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~collberg/Teaching/620/2008/Assignments/tools/DashO/) </li></ul> | [dasho](https://www.preemptive.com/products/dasho/overview) |
| **Dexguard** | Dexguard is an Android application obfuscator, supports all the common features plus a few extra Android-specific abilities.  | <ul><li>Full: Varies</li></ul> | [dexguard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/dexguard) |
| **JObf** | JObf is an open source obfuscator by superblaubeere27. | <ul><li>Free</li></ul> | [jobf](https://github.com/superblaubeere27/obfuscator) |
| **Paramorphism** | Paramorphism is an upcoming obfuscator by Anthony Som. More details will be released as the product's feature set matures. | <ul><li>Full: $100</li></ul> | [paramorphism](https://paramorphism.serenity.enterprises/) |
| **Proguard** | Proguard is one of the most common obfuscators out there. Its one of the oldest and most imporantly, its totally free. It really only supports name obfuscation and not much else. Ironically you can use it on obfuscated jars to weaken name obfuscation into something more workable. | <ul><li>Free</li></ul> | [proguard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard) |
| **Radon** | Radon is an open source obfuscator that is about on par with Zelix _(further below)_ in terms of features. It has a simple to use GUI that can be used to generate a config file, then you can run all further operations with the command-line using your config. | <ul><li>Free</li></ul> | [radon](https://github.com/ItzSomebody/Radon) |
| **Stringer** | Stringer is an unweildy beast in a few regards. The flow obfuscation on high settings is really strong and the string encryption can't be statically reveresed without a LOT of effort _(Essentially requires emulation)_. It boasts some other neat features others don't have like resource protection and reflection obfuscation. Sadly the cooler features are locked away under the enterprise license which I cannot find any information about online. Just assume it costs an arm and a leg.  | <ul><li>Demo: Requires company verification</li><li>Full: Varies</li></ul> | [stringer](https://jfxstore.com/stringer/) |
| **yGuard** | yGuard is similiar to proguard in that its more of a code-shrinker than of an obfuscator. But hey, its free. | <ul><li>Free</li></ul> | [yguard](https://www.yworks.com/products/yguard) |
| **Zelix** | Zelix is another oldie, and their website shows it. Despite the outdated website Zelix is another strong obfuscator with good string and flow encryption. For the features it gives the smallest license is an absolute steal. | <ul><li>Demo: Free, requires company email</li><li>Full: $240+</li></ul> | [zelix klassmaster](https://www.zelix.com/klassmaster/index.html) |
