# SkidSuite 3

SkidSuite 3  _(SS3)_ is a collection of useful tools pertaining to reverse engineering of java applications. This collection may be updated to include SS3-specific tools in the future but will largely consist of externally managed projects.  

> The last iteration _(SS2)_ can be found here:

> * [ZIP](files/SkidSuite2-master.zip)

If you have a useful item to add open an issue or pull request. I'll review the changes and incorperate it if I feel it provides something useful to the toolkit as a whole.
